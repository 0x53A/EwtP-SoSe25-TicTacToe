This directory contains three demo projects.

The first, [demo_neopixel_onboard](./demo_neopixel_onboard), simply flashes the single neopixel on the devboard. That is, it doesn't require any additional connected hardware.

The second demo, [demo_neopixel_matrix](./demo_neopixel_matrix) requires the 16x16 neopixel matrix.

The keyboard demo doesn't work yet.
